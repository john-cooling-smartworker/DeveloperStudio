            <article>
                <h4>In the Beginning</h4>
                <p>Started programming in 1974. Yes, that's fifty years programming experince!</p>
                <p> First coded banking applications using IBM Assempler. Writing the programs out long hand on coding sheets. Coding sheets turned into punch cards by enormous data preparation teams, over fifty people. Cards feed into a IBM 370 computer to assemble, link, and execute.</p>
                <p>Errors were corrected by mentally assembling the code fix and manually hand puching it into a "link deck" for rerun. With this method you saved so much time, days, getting a rerun without having to reassemble the whole program.</p>

        <h2>Development and Operations Project</h2>
         <p><strong>Where to start?</strong> <br>
            Devops covers all the processes from request for proposal all the way to production support. The "dev" part is the softwware development lifecycle best practise.The "ops" part the operations lifecycle best practise. Now this is a hugh amount to learn. The project is to study the best practise processes and produce an online reference for Devops.  
         </p> 
         <p><strong>Breakdown!! </strong><br>
              Its too big to be a single project and there is a neat divide between the two. The "dev" part is the softwware development lifecycle best practise. It is covered in an earlier project "End-to-end Development Project"
