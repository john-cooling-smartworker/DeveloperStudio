                <h4>Box Model Fundamentals</h4>
                <p>Each browser has a default CSS set called the “user agent” developers may wish to reset padding and margin so they can
                apply their style on a clean sheet
                * {
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;

                <ul>
                    <li>margin, the space between the border and outside edge of the element margin-right etc
                    min-width:
                    max-width:
                    min-height:
                    max-height:
                     <p>Center content</p>
                    <p  class="source-code-pro"> margin: 0 auto;</p>

                    <li>padding, the space between content area and border. Every edge can have a different value.
                    padding-bottom: 10px;
                    padding shorthand padding: top right bottom left;
                    the last value can be omitted if left and right sides have the same padding
                    the second last value can be omitted if the top and bottom have the same padding.
                    </li>
                    <li>overflow: hidden | scroll | visible; //what to do with an image that doesn't fit inside the box of its containing
                    element 
                    </li>
                    <li>visibility: hidden | visible | collapse
                    box-sizing: border-box; makes the border, margins and padding inside the box instead of outside the box.
                    box-sizing: border-box:
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Using Percentages on the Box Model</h4>
                <p>Percentages can also be used to set the padding and margin of elements.
                
                <p>When height and width are set using percentages, you learned that the dimensions of child elements are calculated based
                on the dimensions of the parent element.
                </p>
                <p>When percentages are used to set padding and margin, however, they are calculated based only on the width of the parent
                element.
                </p>
                <p>For example, when a property like margin-left is set using a percentage (say 50%), the element will be moved halfway to
                the right in the parent container (as opposed to the child element receiving a margin half of its parent’s margin).
                </p>
                <p>Vertical padding and margin are also calculated based on the width of the parent. Why? Consider the following scenario:
                </p>
                <p>A container div is defined, but its height is not set (meaning it’s flat).
                The container then has a child element added within. The child element does have a set height. This causes the height of
                its parent container to stretch to that height.
                The child element requires a change, and its height is modified. This causes the parent container’s height to also
                stretch to the new height. This cycle occurs endlessly whenever the child element’s height is changed!
                In the scenario above, an unset height (the parent’s) results in a constantly changing height due to changes to the
                child element. This is why vertical padding and margin are based on the width of the parent, and not the height.
                </p>
                <p>
                Note: When using relative sizing, ems and rems should be used to size text and dimensions on the page related to text
                size (i.e. padding around text). This creates a consistent layout based on text size. Otherwise, percentages should be
                used.</p>

            <p>is a measure of how transparent an element is. 0% to 100% expressed as a decimal 0.0 to 1.0
            </p>
            <p>A number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive, or a percentage in the range 0% to 100%, inclusive, representing the opacity of the channel (that is, the value of its alpha channel). Any value outside the interval, though valid, is clamped to the nearest limit in the range.
            </p>
            <p> Value 0, The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible).</p>
            <p>Any number between 0 and 1, The element is translucent (that is, content behind the element can be seen).</p>
            <p>1 (default value), The element is fully opaque (visually solid).</p>
            <p>named colors - 
                <ul>
                    <li> RGB colors - numeric values that describe mix of red, blue, green. Can use HEX (#nnn) or decimal (rgb(n, n, n) Hex color specification - starts with # followed by three hax numbers written as 2 hex digits per number </li>
                    <li>HSL colors - numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, lightness color: hsl(120, 60% 70%); first number is from 0 to 360 and is the hue, the percentages are for saturation (the intensity or purity of the color, 100 is richer) then lightness (0% makes it darker) Hue is based on the color wheel, red is at 0 and 360 degrees HSL is convenient for adjusting colors. HSL good for selecting colors that work well together by selecting colors that have the same lightness and saturation but different hues</li>
                    <li> Opacity and Alpha To use opacity in the hsl color scheme change to hsla instead of hsl. This introduces a forth value called the alpha! A decimal number from zero to one, if alpha is zero color will be completely transparent, if is one color is opaque.</li> 
                    <li>RGB can be handled the same way by using rgba</li>
                    <li>HEX is a little different you just add another number to the hax string, 00 is transparent and ff is opaque </li>

                            <p>p a {} - targets any &lta&gt element that sit inside a &ltp&gt element, even if there are other

            <h3 id="sizing">Sizing</h3>
            <h4>Sizing Fundamentals</h4>                     
                <p>Incorporating relative sizing starts by using units other than pixels. One unit of measurement you can use in CSS to create relatively-sized content is the em, written as em in CSS. Historically, the em represented the width of a capital letter M in the typeface and size being used. That is no longer the case.</p>
                <p>
                Today, the em represents the font-size of the current element or the default base font-size set by the browser if none is given. For example, if the base font of a browser is 16 pixels (which is normally the default size of text in a browser), then 1 em is equal to 16 pixels. 2 ems would equal 32 pixels, and so on.</p>
                <p> The second relative unit of measurement in CSS is the rem, coded as rem.
                </p>
                <p> Rem stands for root em. It acts similar to em, but instead of checking parent elements to size font, it checks the root element. The root element is the &lthtml&gt tag. Most browsers set the font size of &lthtml&gt to 16 pixels, so by default rem measurements will be compared to that value.
                </p>
                <p>To set a different font size for the root element, you can add a CSS rule. Using rem can help ensure consistency of font size and spacing throughout your UI.
                </p>
                <p>If you are interested in sizing elements consistently across an entire website, the rem measurement is the best unit for
                the job. If you’re interested in sizing elements in comparison to other elements nearby, then the em unit would be
                better suited for the job.
                </p>
                <p>To size non-text HTML elements relative to their parent elements on the page you can use percentages.
                </p>
                <p>
                Percentages are often used to size box-model values, like width and height, padding, border, and margins. They can also be used to set positioning properties (top, bottom, left, right).
                </p>
                <p>When percentages are used, elements are sized relative to the dimensions of their parent element (also known as a
                container). Be careful, a child element’s dimensions may be set erroneously if the dimensions of its parent element aren’t set
                first.
                </p>
                <p>Note: Because the box model includes padding, borders, and margins, setting an element’s width to 100% may cause content
                to overflow its parent container. While tempting, 100% should only be used when content will not have padding, border,
                or margin.
                </p>
                <h4>Width: Minimum and Maximum</h4>
                <p>Although relative measurements provide consistent layouts across devices of different screen sizes, elements on a website can lose their integrity when they become too small or large. You can limit how wide an element becomes with the
                following properties:
                </p>
                <p>min-width — ensures a minimum width for an element.
                </p>
                <p>max-width — ensures a maximum width for an element.
                </p>
                <p>When a browser window is narrowed or widened, text can become either very compressed or very spread out, making it
                difficult to read. These two properties ensure that content is legible by limiting the minimum and maximum widths.
                </p>
                <p>Note: The unit of pixels is used to ensure hard limits on the dimensions of the element(s).
                </p>
                <h4>Height: Minimum and Maximum</h4>
                <p>You can also limit the minimum and maximum height of an element.
                </p>
                <p>min-height — ensures a minimum height for an element’s box.
                </p>
                <p>max-height — ensures a maximum height for an element’s box.</p>
                <p>What will happen to the contents of an element if the max-height property is set too low for that element? 
                </p>
                <p>It’s possible
                that content will overflow outside of the element, resulting in content that is not legible.</p>
                <h4>Scaling images and video</h4>
                <p>Many websites contain a variety of different media, like images and videos. When a website contains such media, it’s
                important to make sure that it is scaled proportionally so that users can correctly view it.</p>
                <p class="source-code-pro">.container {
                width: 50%;
                height: 200px;
                overflow: hidden;
                }
                </p>
                <p class="source-code-pro"> 
                .container img {
                max-width: 100%;
                height: auto;
                display: block;
                }
                </p>
                <p>In the example above, .container represents a container div. It is set to a width of 50% (half of the browser’s width, in this example) and a height of 200 pixels. Setting overflow to hidden ensures that any content with dimensions larger than the container will be hidden from view.
                </p>
                <p>The second CSS rule ensures that images scale with the width of the container. The height property is set to auto, meaning an image’s height will automatically scale proportionally with the width. Finally, the last line will display images as block level elements (rather than inline-block, their default state). This will prevent images from attempting to align with other content on the page (like text), which can add unintended margin to the images.
                </p>
                <p>It’s worth memorizing the entire example above. It represents a very common design pattern used to scale images and videos proportionally.
                </p>
                <p>>Note: The example above scales the width of an image (or video) to the width of a container. If the image is larger than the container, the vertical portion of the image will overflow and will not display. To swap this behavior, you can set max-height to 100% and width to auto (essentially swapping the values). This will scale the height of the image with the height of the container instead. If the image is larger than the container, the horizontal portion of the image will
                overflow and not display.
                </p>
                <p>When the height of an image or video is set, then its width can be set to auto so that the media scales proportionally.
                Reversing these two properties and values will also achieve the same result.</p>
                <h4>Scaling Background Images</h4>
                <p>Background images of HTML elements can also be scaled responsively using CSS properties.</p>
                <p class="source-code-pro">body {
                background-image: url('#');
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
                background-position: center;
                background-size: cover;
                }
                </p>
                <p>In the example above, the first CSS declaration sets the background image (# is a placeholder for an image URL in this example). The second declaration instructs the CSS compiler to not repeat the image (by default, images will repeat).
                The third declaration centers the image within the element.
                </p>
                <p>The final declaration, however, is the focus of the example above. It’s what scales the background image. The image will cover the entire background of the element, all while keeping the image in proportion. If the dimensions of the image exceed the dimensions of the container then only a portion of the image will display.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="#responsive">Responsive Design</h3>
            <h4>Responsive Fundamentals</h4>
            <p>Let’s start with the viewport, which is the total viewable area for a user; this area varies depending on device. The viewport is smaller on a mobile device and larger on a desktop.
            
            Based on the size of the viewport, the meta tag (&ltmeta&gt) is used to instruct the browser on how to render the webpage’s scale and dimensions. For instance, say if a web page is 960px and the device is 320px wide. Adding the viewport meta tag will squish the content down until it is 320px — there is no need for the user to zoom out and view the whole page!
            </p>
            <p>We can break down the added &ltmeta&gt tag into the following essential components:      
            </p>          
            <p>the name="viewport" attribute: tells the browser to display the web page at the same width as its screen
            </p>
            <p>the content attribute: defines the values for the &ltmeta&gt tag, including width and initial-scale 
            </p> 
            <p> the width=device-width key-value pair: controls the size of the viewport in which it sets the width of the viewport to equal the width of the device
            </p>
            <p> the initial-scale=1 key-value pair: sets the initial zoom level (Read more about scale at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag#viewport_basics">MDN’s viewport documentation)</a>
            </p>
            <h4>@media queries</h4>
            <p>CSS uses media queries to adapt a website’s content to different screen sizes. With media queries, CSS can detect the size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen.</p>
            <p class="source-code-pro">@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
            body {
            font-size: 12px;
            }
            }</p>
            <p>The example above demonstrates how a media query is applied. The media query defines a rule for screens smaller than 480 pixels (approximately the width of many smartphones in landscape orientation).
            </p>
            <p> Let’s break this example down into its parts:</p>
            <ul> 
           <li> @media — This keyword begins a media query rule and instructs the CSS compiler on how to parse the rest of the rule. 
           </li>
            <li> only screen — Indicates what types of devices should use this rule. In early attempts to target different devices, CSS
            incorporated different media types (screen, print, handheld). The rationale was that by knowing the media type, the
            proper CSS rules could be applied. However, “handheld” and “screen” devices began to occupy a much wider range of sizes
            and having only one CSS rule per media device was not sufficient. screen is the media type always used for displaying
            content, no matter the type of device. The only keyword is added to indicate that this rule only applies to one media
            type (screen).
            </li>
            <li>
            and (max-width : 480px) — This part of the rule is called a media feature, and instructs the CSS compiler to apply the CSS styles to devices with a width of 480 pixels or smaller. Media features are the conditions that must be met in order
            to render the CSS within a media query. CSS rules are nested inside of the media query’s curly braces. The rules will be applied when the media query is met. In
            the example above, the text in the body element is set to a font-size of 12px when the user’s screen is less than 480px.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Specific screen sizes can be targeted by setting multiple width and height media features. min-width and min-height are
            used to set the minimum width and minimum height, respectively. Conversely, max-width and max-height set the maximum
            width and maximum height, respectively.
            
            By using multiple widths and heights, a range can be set for a media query.
            </p>
            <p class="source-code-pro">@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
            /* ruleset for 320px - 480px */
            }
            </p>
            <p>The example above would apply its CSS rules only when the screen size is between 320 pixels and 480 pixels. Notice the use of a second and keyword after the min-width media feature. This allows us to chain two requirements together.
            
            The example above can be written using two separate rules as well:</p>
            <p class="source-code-pro">
                @media only screen and (min-width: 320px) {
                /* ruleset for >= 320px */
                }
                
                
                @media only screen and (min-width: 480px) {
                /* ruleset for >= 480px */
                }

            </p>
            <p>The first media query in the example above will apply CSS rules when the size of the screen meets or exceeds 320 pixels. </p>
            <p>The second media query will then apply CSS rules when the size of the screen meets or exceeds 480 pixels, meaning that it can override CSS rules present in the first media query or apply additional CSS rules that are not already present in the first.</p>
            <p>Both examples above are valid, and it is likely that you will see both patterns used when reading another developer’scode.
            </p>
            <h4>Dots Per Inch</h4>
            <p>Another media feature we can target is screen resolution. Many times we will want to supply higher quality media (images, video, etc.) only to users with screens that can support high resolution media. Targeting screen resolution also helps users void downloading high resolution (large file size) images that their screen may not be able to properly display.
                </p>
            
            <p>To target by resolution, we can use the min-resolution and max-resolution media features. These media features accept a resolution value in either dots per inch (dpi) or dots per centimeter (dpc). Learn more about resolution measurements here.   
            </p>
            <p class="source-code-pro">
                @media only screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
                /* CSS for high resolution screens */
                }
            </p>
            <p>The media query in the example above targets high resolution screens by making sure the screen resolution is at least 300 dots per inch. If the screen resolution query is met, then we can use CSS to display high resolution images and other media.</p>
            <p>Comma Seperated Lists</p>
            <p>If only one of multiple media features in a media query must be met, media features can be separated in a comma separated list. As oppsed to using AND for all conditions must be met. 
            
            For example, if we needed to apply a style when only one of the below is true:
            
            The screen is more than 480 pixels wide OR The screen is in landscape mode
            </p>
            <p>Breakpoints</p>
            <p>We know how to use media queries to apply CSS rules based on screen size and resolution, but how do we determine what queries to set?
            
            The points at which media queries are set are called breakpoints. Breakpoints are the screen sizes at which your web page does not appear properly. For example, if we want to target tablets that are in landscape orientation, we can create the following breakpoint:</p>
            <p class="source-code-pro">@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) and (orientation: landscape) {
            /* CSS ruleset */
            }</p>
            <p>The example above creates a screen size range the size of a tablet in landscape mode and also identifies the
            orientation.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, setting breakpoints for every device imaginable would be incredibly difficult because there are many devices of
            differing shapes and sizes. In addition, new devices are released with new screen sizes every year.
            </p>
            <p>Rather than set breakpoints based on specific devices, the best practice is to resize your browser to view where the website naturally breaks based on its content. The dimensions at which the layout breaks or looks odd become your media query breakpoints. Within those breakpoints, we can adjust the CSS to make the page resize and reorganize.
            </p>
            <p>By observing the dimensions at which a website naturally breaks, you can set media query breakpoints that create the best possible user experience on a project by project basis, rather than forcing every project to fit a certain screen size. Different projects have different needs, and creating a responsive design should be no different.</p>

        <p>CSS files are often kept in a "ccs" or "style" director as part of the site. This is preferred to including CSS styling in the html file because it is easier see, and control when it's a seperate file</p>
        <p class="code"> &lt link href="pathname of the CSS file" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt; </p>
        <p>CSS links are defined in the &lt head &gt section of the html page. It is common to define multiple CSS files, one after another in the &lt head &gt section. When styling in the files clash eg &lth1&gt styling in all files, the styling is applied in the order the files are defined.

        <p>Links are also a core feature of Internet navigation. They power movement from one page to another, thats surfing the web!</p>
        <p>The &lta&gt HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. To link to different website you use an <strong>absulute URL.</strong> Linking to other pages on the same website you don't have to specifiy the domain name you can use shorthand known as <strong>relative URL.</strong></p>
        <h4>Relative URL</h4>
        <p>If all the pages of the site are in the same folder then the value for the href attribute is just the file name.</p>
